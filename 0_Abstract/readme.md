WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM 
Abstract
In automobiles, particularly cars, autos and heavy vehicles, there are wipers.
Wipers are used to clean the windshield of the cars
to operate these wipers, motors are used. these motors are designed to operate in 90 degrees or 150 degrees, depending on the use.
I have not used 180 degrees here, because no wiper in real time rotates 180 degrees.
As STM32IDE is used, along with Qemu, we will show this operation using only 4 LEDs and a switch.
This is so because Qemu supports only those things.
We use single press and long press to denote ON/OFF and frequencies to denote varoius wiper operations.
